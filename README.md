# Chrome Sleep Countdown

## What is Chrome Sleep Countdown?

Chrome Sleep Countdown displays how much sleep you would get if you were to go to bed at that exact moment. For example, if you are supposed to wake up at 8:00am, the countdown will display how much time is between now and 8:00am. This is useful for reminding yourself to go to sleep at a proper time.
